# TWTIM-PythonSite

Following the Tech With Tim Video Tutorial!

The read me will just be the notes from each section of the video.

# INTRO

The idea behind the tutorial is to make a notes app with user authentication utilizing flask.

# Project Demo

Just a sponsor segment but the demo was at least cool.

# Directory structure

There is a specific way to organize our web project in order to keep the information needed straight.

We made the following files: 
auth, views, models, and __init__ 

basically auth is for user auth
views is for the front end
models is for the backend
and init is to initialize something that I don't quite get yet.

# Flask Setup

Why not Django? Flask is less complicated and faster for smaller projects knowing both may be advangateous. 

I have always thought that I could make things from scratch but considering that I just installed 3 packages created by who knows who god knows when I think that the whole 'real coders code from scratch' mentality is good and dead...Thank God.

# Creating a Flask App

So the point of __init__ was so that we can modularize our code. 

in main.py you will see a directive that allows us to import from the website folder but the folder isn't a python module right? Well, because of __init__ it actually is and that allows us to export functions and methods! Pretty cool eh?

So where are we right now? :

- The flask dependencies are installed
- The boiler plate is set up
- The app is capable of being run
- The server can go live without errors but doesn't have any routes
- This is the hypest shit.
