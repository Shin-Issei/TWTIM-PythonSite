# INTRO

The idea behind the tutorial is to make a notes app with user authentication utilizing flask.

# Project Demo

Just a sponsor segment but the demo was at least cool.

There is a specific way to organize our web project in order to keep the information needed straight.

We made the following files: 
auth, views, models, and __init__ 

basically auth is for user auth
views is for the front end
models is for the backend
and init is to initialize something that I don't quite get yet.
